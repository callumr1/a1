<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Callum Robertson<br>
  <strong>Login:</strong> jc429141</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To increase the number of costume sales </li>
  <li>To get younger people (high schoolers and young adults) into cosplaying</li>
  <li>To increase the number of people attending the Cossieplay parties</li>
</ul>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<ul>
  <li> The success of the website will be determined by evaluating the current number of people attending the parties, and buying costumes as well as the traffic to the website over a 4 month period. After that period if the number of people have increased significantly the website will be deemed succesful.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The target audience currently is 35 - 50 year olds, but CossiePlay wishes to increase their target audience to include high shoolers and young adults. So the target audience for the website will be 12 - 35 year olds.</li>
</ul>
